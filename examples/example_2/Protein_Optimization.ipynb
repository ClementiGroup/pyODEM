    "# PyODEM Framework - Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This Notebook will help guide you through fitting the epsilon parameters of a protein structure based model using the new pyODEM package. The package is designed so that the \"heavy lifting\" (e.g. maximum likelihood estimation) is automated, while the loading of data files is done by the user through the creation of several objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The over-arching goal is to take adjust the parameters (epsilon) of a CG-model's Hamiltonian so that the observables the CG model produces matches the observables from some Reference model. This is done iteratively in cycles of \"Simulate -> Optimize -> Simulate -> Optimize...\" until a reasonable agreement between the CG-model observables with the Reference-model observables. Hopefully, the Reference model will simply be real experimental data in the future, but for now we are using an all-atom simulation as a Reference model in order to properly interpret the resultant distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we are going to take the FiP35 ww-domain protein as an example test case. The Reference observables were previously generated from an all-atom model of FiP35, simulated by the D.E. Shaw group. The results of the analysis is included in the folders entitled \"distance\", \"enhance\" and \"q_analysis\". The tutorial will be divided into Three steps. First, a simulation of the coarse-grained model is simulated using the structure-based modeling package from the Onuchic group. Second, some preparation steps are run mainly to prepare observables for analysis while also partitioning the trajectory into discrete clusters of states. In particular, understanding how the partitioning of the trajectory into discrete states occurs would benefit greatly from reviewing the tutorials on the pyEMMA package available form the Noe group in Berlin <http://emma-project.org/latest/ipython.html>. And finally, the last section will deal with setting up a and using the pyODEM to find a new set of parameters for the \"optimize\" step, and then save those new parameters to re-start the \"simulate\" step. All the work in these three sections is to eventually set up the maximum_likelihood object which will be near the end of the final section, expressed as:\n",

    "```\n",
    "solutions = pyODEM.estimators.max_likelihood_estimate(data_formatted, dtrajs, obs, \n",

    "    solver=\"bfgs\", logq=True, kwargs=function_args)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, if you do not wish for simulations to complete to just test the package, you can copy the directory \"example_2/pre_determined_results/iteration_0\" to \"example_2/iteration_0\" and skip the step in Part I that involves making a shell call to GROMACS commands. \n",

    "# Part I: Running Simulations (~1 hour)\n",
    "This section will detail how to use the `model_builder` package to prepare and run a CG model. All CG models breakdown the Hamiltonian to backbone terms (bonds, angles and dihedral) and parwise terms. The backbone terms determine the local interaction between chemically bonded atoms in the protein, while the pairwise terms represent interactions (e.g. hydrophobicity, electrostatics, etc.) between parts of the protein. You can consult \"C. Clementi, H. Nymeyer, J. Onuchic. *Journal of Molecular Biology* (2000) **298**, 937-953\" for an example of what the Hamiltonian would look like. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `model_builder` package is set up so that any external files being used are indexed from 1 while all internal lists are indexed from 0. For example, in the `cacb.gro` file, 1Gly is used instead of 0Gly, while inside the model_builder package, it is atom 0. \n",
    "To construct a CG model, In particular, for our example of FiP35, the relevant files are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `ww_domain.ini`:\n",
    "This is a configuration file for listing the relevant parameters and files for constructing a CG model using the `model_builder` package. In particular, there are two headings [model] and [fittingopts] that are read. The breakdown of the options in each heading is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "  **1.1.** [model] section gives a list of options for representing the energy terms of the CG model\n",
    "    * *topology*: A structure file (e.g. pdb, gro, etc.) that must be loadable with `mdtraj`. This file will be used to determine the backbone parameter files like the bond, angle and dihedral. For our FiP35 example, the file cacb.gro is used to determine backbone parameters. An all-atom pdb can be given, where `model_builder` will then parse the file and automatically construct a coarse representation internally. Not to be confused with the GROMACS usage of \"topology\" to refer to the .top file used for running simulations.\n",
    "    * *bead_repr*: The type and level of coarse-graining, i.e. CA (C_alpha), CACB (C_alpha-C_beta), and awsem (AWSEM three-bead model). For FiP35, it is set to CACB to use a C_alpha-C_beta level of coarse-graining (one backbone bead and one side-chain bead).\n",
    "    * *pairs*: A file path, where the file contains a two-column list of CG atoms forming pairwise contacts, indexed from     1. A Leonnard-Jones 12-10 potential is added for each atom on this list, with the minima of the potential corresponds to the distance between the atoms in the topology given above. This is not in the ww_domain.ini file as instead the pairwise_params_file option is used to allow for a greater degree of control over the atom parameters. \n",
    "    * *pairwise_params_file*: A file path, where each line of the file denotes a pairwise interaction including the pairs, type of function and function parameters. See below for a full explanation. This essentially allows full control of the pairwise prameters in the Hamiltonian. \n",
    "    * *model_params_file*: A file path, where each line gives the epsilon values for the pairwise parameters. The number of lines in this file is the same as the number of files in the pairwise_params_file, and gives the epsilon for its corresponding pairwise potential. These are the parameters used in the optimization framework. \n",
    "    * *cb_volume*: Used specifically when bead_repr=CACB, with possible options including cb_volume, average or flavored. Setting cb_volume=flavored means the size of the CB atoms are selected based upon the type of residue, where larger side-chains have larger volumes. \n",
    "\n",
    "  **1.2.** [fittingopts] section gives a list of options for keeing track of parameters used during the optimization process. None of these parameters have any bearing on writing out the files for running simulations. \n",
    "    * *iteration*: This is used to keep track of which iteration of the pyODEM framework you are on. For example, it determines which files and directories to write.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `cacb.gro`:\n",
    "Structure file that the backbone parameters of the Hamiltonian are based off of (ideal bond distance, ideal angle, ideal dihedral angle). This .gro file has already been constructed by placing the CA atom at the location of the alpha-Carbon and the CB atom at the center-of-mass of the side-chain from an all-atom FiP35 representation. An all-atom structure file also would have been acceptable and would have been processed by model_builder internally to conform to the desired level of coarse-graining. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. `pairwise_params_repulsive`: \n",
    "This is the pairwise params file used in the .ini option \"pairwise_params_file\". The file consists of comment lines with the hashtag symbol (#), followed by columns of information, with each line corresponding to a specific pairwise interaction. The column widths do not need to be an exact width but require white-space between columns. For each line, a pairwise interaction between atoms i and j in the CG representation:\n",
    "\n",
    "  **3.1.** Breakdown of Columns:\n",
    "    * Column 1: Atom i, indexed from 1 in the CG representation.\n",
    "    * Column 2: Atom j, indexed from 1 in the CG representation.\n",
    "    * Column 3: A count of the number of pairwise function's index (indexing from 0 as it is used internally). \n",
    "    * Column 4: A string giving the type of potential (e.g. LJ1210, LJ126, LJ12GAUSSIAN)\n",
    "    * Column 5-: All columns starting with the fifth column are used to parameterize the pairwise potential.\n",
    "    \n",
    "  **3.2.** Example for FiP35:\n",
    "    * Column 1 - Column 2: The interactions are only defined between CA-CA pairs and CB-CB pairs that are not connected by any backbone interactions (bond, angle, or dihedral), i.e. CA-CA pairwise interactions are atleast 4 residues apart.\n",
    "    * Column 3: Counts from 0 to 932, and corresond to the list-index of that potential in the Hamiltonian._pairs list, see Appendix I below for more details on accessing potentials inside the Hamiltonian.\n",
    "    * Column 4: This is either LJ12GAUSSIAN or LJ12GAUSSIANTANH. Please refer to  \"R.R. Cheng, M. Raghunathan, J.K. Noel and J.N. Onuchic *Protein Science* (2016) **25**, p114\" where equations 5 and 6 give the functional form of the LJ12GAUSSIAN and LJ12GAUSSIANTANH respectively. Also, refer to the website: http://smog-server.org/extension/gauss.html ,for a good explanation of the advantage of the LJ12GAUSSIAN potential over the Leonnard-Jones-12-10 potential (LJ1210) traditionally used in CG models. The purpose of these LJ12GAUSSIAN type potentials is to provide a attractive and extra repulsive potential while maintaining the same hard-wall 1/r^12 excluded volume interaction regardless of the strength of the attractive/repulsive well. LJ12GAUSSIAN is used for pairs forming contacts in the native state, while LJ12GAUSSIANTANH is used for all pairs not forming native contacts in the native state. LJ12GAUSSIANTANH also allows the contact to not only have a Gaussian attractive well, but a slightly more repulsive Tanh function barrier. \n",
    "    * Column 5: Gives the excluded valume r_0 used in the (r_0/r)^12 part of both functions.\n",
    "    * Column 6: Gives the minima of the Gaussian well, or x0 when tanh(x-x0) = 1/2. \n",
    "    * Column 7: Gives the standard-width of the Gaussian well, and the shift for the Tanh function. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. `model_params`:\n",
    "The `model_params` file contains all the parameters, `epsilon`, that will be changed during the pyODEM optimization step. Each line corresponds to the pairwise potential of the same line in pairwise_params_repulsive. The `epsilon` gives the scale of the attractive or extra repulsive barrier. For example, in the LJ12GAUSSIAN, the value of `epsilon` is constrained to be greater than 0 and larger values denote deeper (stronger) attractive wells (forces). For the LJ12GAUSSIANTANH potentials, the value of `epsilon` can switch between positive and negative values. A negative `epsilon` means the repulsive LJ12TANH function is used, with the absolute value of the `epsilon` scaling the height of the repulsive barrier. A positive value then means the LJ12GAUSSIAN attractive well potentail will be used. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Determine \"native\" contacts: There are several ways of determining native contacts, such as just taking atoms (e.g. sharp cutoff). In our case, we use the SMOG shadow contact map to determine our native contacts <http://smog-server.org/Shadow.html>. This was previously done and used in generating the original `pairwise_params_repulsive` and `model_params` files. \n",
    "\n",
    "This section will mainly use the `model_builder` package, which was abbreviated as `mdb` during the import step for writing out topology files for GROMACS, and the `simulation` package for writing out GROMACS .mdp files (`mdp_writer`). Furthermore, the `os` and `subprocess` (`sb`) package is used for making directories and executing GROMACS commands. Running a simulation will approximately an hour. "

However, this section will not detail all the features of the pyEMMA software as Frank Noe's group has developed a very nice set of tutorials detailing their package. The discrete trajectory and the stationary distribution from the MSM will be all you need from pyEMMA to run the optimization.\n",

This will later be used during the optimization procedure when comparing observables with the Reference observables for fitting. \n",

    "\n",
    "This has several steps, but the goal is to get a discrete cluster of states followed by the probability, or stationary distribution, of each state as found from the MSM. In a well sampled system (sampled equilibrium distribution), the stationary distribution from the MSM won't be different from the stationary distribution without an MSM (i.e. N_i / N for N_i conformations in discrete state i with a total of N states). However, in larger systems where the equilibrium distribution is not truly found, a MSM can be used to augment and find the true equilibrium distribution. The steps below will follow this outline:\n",
    "1. Compute TICA on the trajectory.\n",
    "2. Cluster on ~sqrt(N) number of states. This was determined by the Noe group to be an ideal number of clusters.\n",
    "3. Compute an MSM.\n",
    "4. End with the discrete trajectory, `dtrajs`, and the stationary distribution, `stationary_distribution`.\n",

    "This section will make heavy use of the pyemma package, so please do consult their documentation for more information. Rather than repeating all their information here, I'll focus on just making the necessary components. In particular for FiP35, we will use 170 discrete states. \n",

    "Recall, the main purpose of this step is to group structurally similar conformations in the trajectory into discrete states so the whole set of states is re-weighted together rather than each state individually. For that, TICA alone would be sufficient. But we also want to recover the true equilibrium distribution, which will be acquired by computing the MSM. In the end, we will have 170 structurally similar FiP35 discrete states, along with the proper equilibrium probability of each of those states. \n"

    "Now that the pyODEM objects are prepared, it is time to actually optimize the Q value and determine a new set of epsilons. However, first we should determine the parameters for the optimization. The optimization uses a Newton-like search in the parameter space of epsilons to find the epsilons that give the smallest value for -log(Q). Therefore, these kinds of non-linear optimization problems require providing a bounds to restrict the search space as well as a termination criteria for when to stop the search. Two parameters in particular need to be determined by the user. For FiP35, well-determined parameters are already found and are given below, as well as an explanation for why those values were selected.\n",

A reasonable value to pick would be to bound each epsilon to +/-0.3 of its starting value, which was determined through several attempts of optimization for FiP35. Furthermore, when we compute the bounds, we also ensure that if an epsilon is non-negative, it is restricted to the lowest value of -0.1, to ensure a potential doesn't become repulsive too quickly. This was also determined through trial and error, where a very negative potential severely restrict sampling of that pair. **note:** Allowing large changes such as +/-0.8 would indeed allow the pyODEM framework to change epsilons quickly and search a larger section of parameter space, but such a large step in parameter space is not advised. This is because the quality factor Q depends on the re-weighting of the Hamiltonian by changing the epsilons, that any large step would lead to a poorly defined Hamiltonian. However, decreasing the bounds to say +/-0.1 would allow a smaller step and ensure you are always in a well-defined region for the re-weighted Hamiltonian, but it would also prevent the pyODEM framework from determining the ideal epsilons quickly.

    "**termination criteria** : The optimization is terminated with gtol. If you want to use a quick optimization for FiP35 just to test, gtol=0.1 allows for a reasonably large change without taking so long. For production runs, gtol=0.001 would be better. Decreasing gtol would require the gradient to become smaller before termination. This can actually lead to meaningful changes in epsilons. Again, gtol=0.001 was found to work well for the FiP35 use case here, but maybe not necessarily for all future use cases. In truth, a rigorous cross-validation method should be used at each iteration step to determine this parameter perfectly, and is in fact currently being implemented.\n",

Several things are ommitted for other tutorials, for example the model_builder page has examples for building the starting set of input files if required. The pyEMMA package has quite a few examples for detailing the analysis better. Reading those packages documentation and going through their examples would greatly improve your understanding for the steps shown in Part I and part II, and can greatly augment your understanding of the pyODEM framework. \n",

There is a definitive criteria our group has been using for the `model_builder` package: zero-index for things internally to the `model_builder` package, and one-index for things external to the `model_builder` package. This is relatively in line with the way other packages have handled this disconnect between the world and python, i.e. `mdtraj`. A few examples:\n",
    "1. Topology files for Gromacs, like .gro and .top files, are always indexed assuming starting with 1. When using these files by model_builder, it assumes this schematic was followed when reading those types of files.\n",
    "2. The atom pairs involved in a pairwise potential are always written and read as indexing starting from 1. However inside the code, this is automatically translated so using any methods inside, you would index from 0. This minimizes arithmetic when trying to determine residues for the atoms in the pairwise_potentials files when comparing to a .pdb file for example. "

    "The pairwwise potential functions, as mentioned earlier in the notebook, come in many flavors. In particular, the FiP35 used two non-LeonnardJones like interactiosn that are probably worth looking at in greater detail. For this section, the code would be located in `model_builder/models/potentials/` for structure based and all-atom like models. First, load a model. If it is still iteration=0, then we should expect the nonnative pairwise parameters have epsilon=0 while the native pairwise potentials have epsilon=1."

    "In the code block below, we can start playing with the potentials. For example, we can use the first pairwise potential, a switchatble gaussian or tanh (attractive or repulsive) potential. By changing the values we can see how the different potentials look, and what the effect of changing epsilons are. In the very simple case, we plot it for epsilon = -1, 0, and 1 in the red, black, and blue curves respectively. Here, it is clear that the Tanh repulsive function isn't just a simple repulsive function, but rather adds a gradual step to prevent contact formation, but leaves the excluded volume mostly intact. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the same methods don't work for regular LJ12Gaussian potential. In general, all the pair-potentials were designed to be static, as in you can't change self.eps and expect everything to work. The special method `PairPotential.set_epsilon()` only exists for specific cases we wanted to allow it. If you wanted to plot the LJ12Gaussian potential at a variety of epsilons, you would have to initialize a new object for each epsilon. "
